# Low-level chat program

This project consists of a chat service, ideal for computers within a same LAN
network. It is programmed in C++, and uses the standard socket libraries
present in Linux systems. Although it is initially programmed to work under
Linux, later versions will add support to Windows computers.

The UI implementation (pending) will be done with ncurses, although later
versions might implement a GUI (like Qt) to be used in Windows.

This project is under heavy development, and it isn't functional yet.
